# Pray Times ICS #

Pray Times ICS is a project aims at creating a Muslim five daily prayer time annual calendar in an iCalendar/ICS format for a given geographical location.

The calendar feeds from Pray Times ICS can be imported into or subscribed to from web or desktop calendars, such as Google Calendar, MS Outlook, Apple iCal etc., or be published.

Pray Times ICS is also a smart phone friendly web application that can be used to quickly lookup times for prayer on an iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, or any HTML5 compliant browser.
